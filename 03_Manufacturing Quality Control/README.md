  <summary><strong>🏭 Manufacturing Quality Control with Control Charts</strong></summary>

### 🧾 Project Summary  
This project focused on improving quality control in a manufacturing setup using **Statistical Process Control (SPC)** techniques. I simulated realistic defect data and used different types of **control charts** (like P-Chart, CUSUM, and EWMA) to detect changes in process performance. The goal was to build a system that can monitor, detect, and visualize issues in production before they become big problems.

### 🧩 What I Implemented  
- **📊 Simulated Manufacturing Data**: Generated realistic defect data and introduced process shifts to test how well detection works  
- **📉 Control Charts**:
  - **P-Chart** for overall defect monitoring  
  - **CUSUM** for catching small shifts early  
  - **EWMA** for smooth trend tracking  
  - **Trend analysis** with statistical testing  
- **📐 Advanced Analytics**:
  - Hypothesis testing to flag unusual behavior  
  - Cp index to measure process capability  
  - Run length and rule violations to catch systematic errors  
- **📈 Visualization**:
  - Annotated charts for clarity  
  - Multiple chart types in one view  
  - Indicators for sudden changes and gradual drifts

---

### 🧠 Key Learnings & Insights  
- **CUSUM** was the best at detecting small shifts  
- **EWMA** provided smooth and easy-to-understand trends  
- Simulated shifts (like on Day 30) were **correctly detected**  
- Using multiple charts together gave a more complete picture  
- Rule violations helped catch trends before they became serious problems  
- **Cp Index** gave a clear score for how capable the process was

---

### ✅ Outcomes  
- Early detection of issues = faster responses  
- Reduced false alarms with statistical validation  
- Visual insights made it easier to explain trends  
- System was scalable, automated, and handled errors well

---

### 💬 Recommendations  
- Use **multiple control charts** for better monitoring  
- Set up **automated checks** for run rule violations  
- Use **CUSUM** for detecting early shifts  
- Track gradual changes using **EWMA**  
- Periodically review control limits and model assumptions

---

### 🚀 Future Improvements  
- Integrate with **real-time factory data**  
- Add **machine learning** for smarter anomaly detection  
- Enable **auto-reporting** for quality updates  
- Include more statistical tests & better visualizations

---

### 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (in Jupyter Notebook)  
- `NumPy` & `Pandas` – Data processing  
- `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` – Charting & visualization  
- `SciPy` – Statistical analysis
