  <summary><strong>🏏 IPL Data Analysis – Team Performance & Statistical Insights</strong></summary>

### 🧾 Project Overview  
This project dives deep into **Indian Premier League (IPL)** match data to analyze team performance, scoring patterns, and match trends across seasons. From basic comparisons to advanced statistical testing, I explored how different factors like home advantage or match type impact outcomes.

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Tech Stack  
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**  
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `statsmodels`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`

---

### 🔍 Data Processing & Feature Engineering  
- Cleaned match data (dates, types, missing values)  
- Engineered features like:
  - **Match period** (before/after 2018)
  - **Run rate** per 20 overs
  - **Match type**: League vs Playoff
  - **Home/Away flags**
  - **Season aggregations**

---

### 📊 Analysis & Statistical Techniques  

#### 🧪 Statistical Analysis:
- **Normality Tests**: Shapiro-Wilk, KDE, skewness/kurtosis  
- **Comparative Tests**: Mann-Whitney U, confidence intervals, effect size  
- **Regression**: Linear trends & performance predictions  
- **Bootstrap sampling** for robust estimates

#### 🧠 Key Analysis Areas:
- **Match Type**: League vs Playoff, Home vs Away  
- **Seasonal Trends**: Year-over-year run rates, scoring patterns  
- **Team Metrics**: Consistency, playoff history, home advantage  
- **Outcome Metrics**: Total runs, win/loss trends

---

### 📈 Visualizations  
- **Static**: Box plots, bar charts, violin plots, histograms, line plots  
- **Interactive**: Hover info, dynamic filters, multi-panel comparisons using `plotly`

---

### 📌 Key Findings  
- **Consistent Teams**: Some teams outperform regularly in playoffs  
- **Scoring Evolution**: Run rates have increased over seasons  
- **Venue Effects**: Performance changes by location  
- **Statistical Insight**: Most scoring data is **not normally distributed** – non-parametric methods worked better

---

### 🚀 Applications & Extensions  
- Useful for **team strategy planning**  
- Can be extended to:
  - **Player-level analytics**
  - **Predictive modeling**
  - **Live match data integration**

---

### 🧠 Project Learnings  
- Built a strong pipeline for data cleaning and feature creation  
- Applied rigorous statistical testing and visual validation  
- Gained deep insights into match structure and scoring behavior  
- Demonstrated how analytics can inform IPL strategies

---

### 💻 Technical Highlights  
- Used **modular code structure** for better readability  
- Combined **classical stats with visual storytelling**  
- Validated findings with **effect sizes, bootstrap resampling**, and confidence intervals  
- Managed messy real-world sports data effectively
