### 🛠️ Tools & Tech Stack  
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**  
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, `statsmodels`

---

### 🔍 Key Areas Analyzed  
- **Gender Participation**: Voter trends based on gender  
- **Vote Share**: Trends in party vote percentages  
- **Seat Distribution**: Party seat trends over years  
- **Turnout Analysis**: Voter turnout over time & by state  
- **Inequality Metrics**: 
  - **Gini Coefficient** to assess vote inequality  
  - **Skewness** to understand vote distribution  
- **State Focus**: Detailed analysis of states like **Gujarat**

---

### 📊 Statistical Techniques  
- **Descriptive stats**: Mean, median, skewness  
- **ANOVA**: To test variance across multiple groups  
- **Correlation Analysis**: To find relationships between features  
- **Missing Value Treatment**: Cleaned and imputed missing data  
- **Time-Series Aggregation**: Trend analysis over decades

---

### 📈 Visualizations  
- **Pie Charts**: Gender and vote distribution  
- **Line Graphs**: Voter turnout, party trends  
- **Bar Graphs**: State-wise vote share  
- **Heatmaps**: Correlation matrix and Gini comparisons

---

### 🧠 Key Insights  
- Female voter turnout has gradually increased since the 90s  
- Certain states consistently show higher voter engagement  
- Vote inequality has reduced over the decades (based on Gini)  
- Some parties dominate specific states while showing declining trends nationally  
- ANOVA results reveal statistically significant variation across parties and states

---

### 🧪 Methodology Highlights
